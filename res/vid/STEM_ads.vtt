00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.580 align:middle line:84%
the one of the things that we're

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.490 align:middle line:84%
realizing is that when teachers have the

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.880 align:middle line:84%
opportunity to experience stem

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.320 align:middle line:84%
themselves the problem-solving the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.330 align:middle line:84%
cooperative learning that they're not

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.680 align:middle line:84%
having a teacher tell them the answer

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and they see the success that the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.390 align:middle line:84%
students have there's no going back

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.789 align:middle line:84%
we've all been in those professional

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.920 align:middle line:84%
development sessions where the presenter

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.649 align:middle line:84%
says all right we know how important

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.649 align:middle line:84%
instructional strategies are and

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:84%
engagement and then they sit there for

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.160 align:middle line:84%
two hours and read a PowerPoint to us

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.960 align:middle line:84%
that's not our professional elements at

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.280 align:middle line:84%
all the atmosphere is just different

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.930 align:middle line:84%
it's not like teaching in a school year

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.030 align:middle line:84%
like I have so much fun doing this even

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.070 align:middle line:84%
though I'm a teacher my students at

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.110 align:middle line:84%
school we have so much requirements I

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.059 align:middle line:84%
don't get that time to see them excel

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.469 align:middle line:84%
fully and they're creative and

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.180 align:middle line:84%
problem-solving ideas we're here it's

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.980 align:middle line:84%
completely fund based we're really

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.930 align:middle line:84%
trying to emulate that in our

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.550 align:middle line:84%
professional development and allow

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.060 align:middle line:84%
teachers to do what we're expecting the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:84%
students my biggest takeaway from the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.680 align:middle line:84%
experience overall is the ability to

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.500 align:middle line:84%
connect with other teachers and really

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.810 align:middle line:84%
being able to engross myself over the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.180 align:middle line:84%
summer in a summer long learning process

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.590 align:middle line:84%
rather than a one-day professional

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.299 align:middle line:84%
development I think one of the things

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.150 align:middle line:84%
that we do best is we have the ability

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.860 align:middle line:84%
to customize our professional

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.180 align:middle line:84%
development to meet the needs of the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:84%
school because we don't want to be that

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.170 align:middle line:84%
one little thing that you know seemed

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.630 align:middle line:84%
great but nothing actually ends up with

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.630 align:middle line:84%
it
